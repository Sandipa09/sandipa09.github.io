Welcome! I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Anisfield School of Business](https://www.ramapo.edu/asb/) in [Ramapo College of New Jersey](https://www.ramapo.edu/). 
I am a Global Labor Organization (GLO) Research Fellow and was selected as a [Virtual Young Scholar](https://glabor.org/user/sandipab/) (VirtYS) by the GLO for the year 2023-24. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (UB)](http://www.buffalo.edu/) in 2023. Prior to joining my Ph.D., I worked as a Business Analyst at [Genpact](https://www.genpact.com/), India. I received my Master's and Bachelor's in Economics from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India.

My research interests broadly lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Development Economics, Labor Economics, Health Economics, and Public Economics. I work on the evaluation of economic policies, the economics of education, gender roles, intergenerational effects, immigration issues, and human capital acquisitions. I am also interested in studying topics of discrimination, labor market inefficiencies of earning disparities, and the health of workers affecting economic outcomes.
