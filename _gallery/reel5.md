title: "Commitment to Teaching Excellence"
description: "I’ve always loved the quiet rigor of research — but stepping into the classroom brings a different kind of energy. Teaching isn’t just something I do; it’s something that fuels me. Sharing ideas, sparking curiosity, and learning from students as much as teaching them — that’s what makes academia feel like home."
